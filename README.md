# Galytix Assignment ‚Äì Machine Learning & NLP

This repository contains the full solution to a data science assignment involving two components:

1. **Machine Learning Task:**  
   Binary classification using a Random Forest model, evaluated via cross-validation and feature importance methods.

2. **NLP Task:**  
   Word embedding analysis using the pre-trained GoogleNews Word2Vec model.

## üìÅ Files & Structure


This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks as part of a data science assignment:

- `1.0-gk-ml-assignment.ipynb`: Predictive modeling using Random Forests and feature evaluation
- `1.0-gk-nlp-assignment.ipynb`: Word embedding analysis using pre-trained Word2Vec vectors

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

**Note:** Due to time limitations, `pip` was used instead of `conda` for dependency management.

To install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Word2Vec Pre-trained Model 

This project requires the GoogleNews Word2Vec model (GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin).  
Due to licensing restrictions, the binary file is not included in this repository.
